### `drskill` Spots Context Issues

`drskill` is `brew doctor` for your agent's loadout. Coding agents load Skills and connect to MCP servers before you type a word. `drskill` looks at every agent on your machine or in your repo, works out exactly which skills and which servers each one loads — including skills delivered through installed plugins and extensions — and checks the whole set for problems.

On the skill side it finds:

1. Skills that shadow each other
2. Skills loaded twice
3. Duplicate or near-duplicate skills
4. Skills that break the SKILL.md spec
5. Broken symlinks
6. Drift against your lockfile
7. Skills that burn too many tokens

On the MCP side it finds:

1. The same server configured twice with drifted settings
2. Secrets sitting in a committable config file
3. Unpinned server packages that run whatever publishes next
4. Server commands that no longer exist
5. Tools whose descriptions collide with each other or with a skill
6. Servers that quietly change their tools after you approved them
7. Tool text carrying hidden instructions, credential paths, or steering toward or away from other tools

The last three need `drskill` to connect to the servers, which it does only when you ask.

Every problem it reports ends in a command: a fix command or a command to acknowledge the problem and move on. `drskill` reads your files and never installs, edits, or deletes a skill. It makes zero calls to an LLM unless you opt in with `--deep`, and it never launches or connects to an MCP server unless you opt in with `--mcp-connect`.

Scanning covers the loadout your agents consume, wherever it comes from. For Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot, and droid, that includes each installed plugin's skills, read straight from the plugin store: enabled plugins join the loadout with their suite attributed, while disabled plugins and stale cached versions are never visited.

`drskill lint` covers what you author. Point it at a plugin, a skill, a marketplace, or an MCP config you are writing, and it checks plugins against the [Agent Plugins specification](https://agent-plugins.org) or Claude Code's own plugin format, checks marketplace descriptors for unpinned or shell-running plugin sources, runs the same content checks over everything inside, and exits with a code CI can gate on.

Use `drskill` to:

- Learn why an agent reaches for the wrong skill or tool, e.g. two descriptions overlap so a router cannot tell them apart
- Catch config risks before they ship, e.g. a secret in a committed file or an unpinned server package
- Notice when your loadout changes (without you doing anything), e.g. a skill that drifted from its lockfile or a server that rewrote a tool description
- Write skill and tool descriptions that do not clash with other libraries
- Lint a plugin, skill, marketplace, or MCP config before you publish it, and gate the release in CI
- See which skills and MCP tools your agents actually use, and read the queries that triggered them

## Install

```
uv tool install drskill
```

This installs everything, including the model-judged deep checks and the MCP server connection support.

For a minimal install, e.g. in CI, where neither is used, install the core package instead:

```
uv tool install drskill-core
```

## Quick start

Run a scan from the root of a project:

```
drskill scan
```

This detects every coding agent it can find, resolves each one's effective skill set, and prints a report grouped by severity. Each finding names the harnesses it affects and ends in a fix command or an ack command.

Write a starter ledger file with default budgets and thresholds:

```
drskill init
```

Acknowledge (`ack`) a finding so it stops showing up until the skill's content changes. There are four forms:

```
drskill ack fe5b                     # one finding, by the id shown in the report
drskill ack near-duplicate docx-report documentation-writer   # one finding, named in full
drskill ack injection-egress         # every finding of one check
drskill ack --all                    # every active finding
```

Walk the findings one at a time and decide each with one keypress:

```
drskill review
```

`review` shows each finding with its full evidence and takes single-key actions: 

- `a` acks it, 
- `n` acks it with a note, 
- `f` queues its fix commands for a copy and paste block at the end, 
- `s` skips it, 
- and `q` quits. 

Each ack is written the moment you press the key, to the same ledger the `ack` command would pick: the project's `drskill.toml`, or `~/.drskill.toml` when the finding involves only machine-level skills. 

Quitting midway loses nothing, and the exit summary lists what was acked into which ledger. `review` only runs in a real terminal. When stdin or stdout is not a TTY, or `CI` or `DRSKILL_NO_INTERACTIVE` is set, it prints one line pointing at `scan` and `ack` and exits. `scan` itself never prompts, so a script or an agent calling drskill can never get stuck at a prompt.

Print the full evidence for a finding, or for a whole check class:

```
drskill show fe5b
drskill show injection-egress
```

List every harness's effective skill set with token counts:

```
drskill list --tokens
```

Scan and also print each harness's skill table in one run:

```
drskill scan --detailed
```

Scope the scan to a single harness and see exactly what that harness sees:

```
drskill scan --harness pi
drskill scan --harness claude-code
```

An unknown harness id is an error that names the valid ids. Harnesses that are detected but load no skills are hidden from the tables by default; a closing line names them, and `--all` shows them.

Run in CI, where any unacknowledged warning should fail the build:

```
drskill scan --ci
```

### Example scans

A few scans you might run:

Deeply check one agent's skills and MCPs. This scopes the scan to Claude Code and uses the model to judge which overlap warnings are real:

```
drskill scan --mcp-connect --harness claude-code --deep
```

Do a full audit before a Skill or MCP release. This judges skill overlaps and connects to every MCP server to read its tools:

```
drskill scan --deep --mcp-connect
```

Judge everything in one pass, with no cap on model calls:

```
drskill scan --deep --max-calls all
```

Gate a pull request. This connects to servers, judges overlaps, and fails the build on any unacknowledged warning:

```
drskill scan --deep --mcp-connect --ci
```

## Lint what you publish

Everything above checks the loadout your agents consume. `drskill lint` turns the same checks on the things you author. Point it at one thing and it works out what that thing is:

```
drskill lint ./my-plugin        # an Agent Plugins directory with a plugin.json
drskill lint ./my-cc-plugin     # a Claude Code plugin, manifest at .claude-plugin/plugin.json
drskill lint ./skills/foo       # a skill folder, or its SKILL.md
drskill lint ./mcp.json         # an MCP config file
drskill lint ./my-marketplace   # a marketplace directory or marketplace.json file
```

A plugin is checked against the [Agent Plugins 1.0.0 specification](https://agent-plugins.org): the `plugin.json` manifest and its name rules, which skills a client will actually discover, `mcp.json` transports and placeholder rules, and symlinks that escape the plugin root. On top of the spec checks, every skill inside the plugin gets the same content checks as `scan` (the SKILL.md spec, description quality, token budget, and injection checks), and every server in its `mcp.json` gets the static MCP checks. A plugin using Claude Code's own layout, with the manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, gets the equivalent Claude Code manifest checks instead of the Agent Plugins spec checks; a plugin that ships both manifests gets both suites. Either way, a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` sitting alongside the manifest is picked up and checked too.

A marketplace target — a directory or a bare `marketplace.json` — gets the marketplace supply-chain checks: manifest validity, and whether each listed plugin's source is pinned to something immutable (a git sha, an npm version, an archive sha256) rather than a movable ref or an unpinned default branch.

A skill target runs just the skill checks. An MCP config target depends on the file. A file with the Agent Plugins `$schema`, or sitting next to a `plugin.json`, is checked against the spec's `mcp.json` rules. A plain `mcpServers` file, like a `.mcp.json`, has no spec to enforce, so it gets the structural and security checks only.

Lint is built for CI:

```
drskill lint ./my-plugin --fail-on warn --json
```

Exit code 0 is clean, 1 means findings at or above the failure threshold (errors by default; `--fail-on warn` includes warnings), and 2 is a usage error. `--json` prints findings as JSON and nothing else. Acks work in lint exactly as in `scan`: pass `--lint` to `ack` with the same target you linted, and the finding ids or check ids from the lint report resolve against that target's findings:

```
drskill lint ./my-marketplace           # reports [3f2a] marketplace-unpinned-source ...
drskill ack --lint ./my-marketplace 3f2a
```

The ack lands in the `drskill.toml` nearest the linted target — the ledger lint reads back — and the manifest and marketplace checks fingerprint content rather than paths, so a committed ack holds across checkouts and CI without weakening the check.

`--deep` and `--mcp-connect` opt into the model-judged checks and the live server checks, exactly as they do for `scan`. Without them, lint makes no LLM calls and connects to nothing.

Lint auto-detects the layout: a `plugin.json` at the directory root is the Agent Plugins layout, and a manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is Claude Code's layout. `--type plugin` and `--type marketplace` force the kind when a path is ambiguous.

## Audit your usage

`drskill scan` looks at the loadout as configured. `drskill audit` looks at how you actually used it. It reads the local session traces that Claude Code, Codex, Pi, and Copilot already write to disk, and ranks which skills and MCP tools actually got invoked. `drskill audit <name>` drills into one skill or tool and shows each invocation in context: the full user message that preceded it, how it was triggered (an explicit tool call, a slash command, or a SKILL.md read), the agent's reasoning right before it on harnesses that record reasoning, and the exact trace file and line so you can open the transcript at that moment.

Run it in a project to see that project's usage:

```
drskill audit
```

```
claude-code  coverage: 2026-07-20 to 2026-07-24 · 6 sessions · 57 invocations
name                        kind   uses  share  sessions  last used
superpowers:brainstorming  skill  14    25%    6         2026-07-23
superpowers:writing-plans  skill  8     14%    5         2026-07-23
plain-writing              skill  6     11%    5         2026-07-23
```

Widen to every project on the machine, and look at the last 30 days only:

```
drskill audit --global --since 30d
```

To audit only your most recent session, pass `--last`. It applies the normal
scope filters first, so it means the newest session for this project, or the
newest session anywhere when combined with `--global`:

```
drskill audit --last
drskill audit --last --global --harness claude-code
```

To audit one specific trace file, pass `--file`. The parser is inferred from
the file's location, e.g., a path under `~/.claude/projects/` is read as a
Claude Code trace. For a file outside the known trace locations, add
`--harness` to name the parser. A `--file` audit reads the whole file even
when its sessions belong to another project, and it skips the audit cache:

```
drskill audit --file ~/.claude/projects/-Users-you-proj/abc123.jsonl
drskill audit --file ./exported-session.jsonl --harness claude-code
```

Drill into one skill to see the queries that led to it:

```
drskill audit overturemaps
```

```
overturemaps (skill)  codex 1
  2026-07-12 17:56  codex  ~/project
    via: SKILL.md read
    query: I need to find coffee shops near a set of addresses…
    trace: ~/.codex/sessions/2026/07/12/rollout-2026-07-12T10-54-06.jsonl:214
```

A skill name and an MCP tool name can collide, so `drskill audit <name>` also takes the form `server:tool` to say which one you mean:

```
drskill audit browser:get_screenshot --global
```

A few things to know about the numbers:

- On Codex and for Pi's automatic skill loading, a skill count comes from seeing the agent read that skill's SKILL.md file. These rows carry a `~` marker. Pi counts native `read` calls only when a matching tool result confirms success, not shell mentions of a path. A confirmed read is evidence of a finalized read outcome, not that the agent followed the instructions or completed the task.
- Expanded `/skill:name` blocks at the start of a user message count explicitly. They are instruction-delivery evidence, not authenticated slash-command provenance: pasted or injected text can look identical, so a wrapper shows the instructions were delivered rather than that a slash command was typed. An exact normalized wrapper location/read path match in the same turn counts as one combined observation, while preserving both evidence rows and their separate source locators. Missing locations and basename-only matches remain unmerged.
- Pi's retained structured codemode reads now flow through the audit cache and reports. Delivery, skill-file reads, and explicitly declared supporting reads stay separate; physical nested occurrences, verified distinct executions and unresolved ownership are separate counts. Unknown old/interrupted/child coverage prevents confident unused classifications. See [Pi evidence-aware audit](docs/pi-audit-evidence.md) for matching rules, limitations, sanitized demos and `--file --branch ENTRY_ID` raw-branch selection. [Windows recorded paths](docs/pi-windows-paths.md) now resolve drive-absolute, ordinary UNC and relative paths against recorded Windows cwd; attribution remains case-sensitive and does not guess Windows/WSL aliases.
- Pi follows session-tree parent links for query and reasoning context and honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` for skill and session discovery.
- Local Pi package directories declared in settings are scanned only when their skill roots are explicit literal directories or the conventional `skills/`. Package discovery follows Pi's leaf rule: once a directory contains `SKILL.md` it is a skill root, so nested example or reference `SKILL.md` files are not reported as separate skills. npm/git/URL packages are not resolved. Manifest resource patterns (globs, exclusions, and brace/extglob/piped forms such as `skills/{a,b}` or `skills/@(a|b)`) are reported as unsupported rather than guessed, as is every nonempty settings-level `skills` filter including exact paths; project `autoload: false` skill deltas are not resolved. Explicitly empty `skills` declarations and filters are honored.
- Codex encrypts its reasoning, so audit cannot show reasoning for Codex invocations.
- Copilot records neither reasoning nor the structured arguments of a tool call, so its drill-downs are thinner than the other harnesses.
- Each harness keeps traces for a different length of time, so a raw count comparison across harnesses can mislead. The cross-harness rollup at the bottom of the report ranks by invocations per week within each harness's own coverage window instead, and says so when the windows differ a lot.

The report includes an Unused section listing skills, commands, and MCP tools from the scan that received zero invocations in the covered trace history. To avoid false positives from sparse history, the Unused section applies two guards: the harness's trace coverage must span the configured threshold to ensure enough history to trust the absence of invocations, and skills or tools from pinned installs younger than the threshold are excluded. The coverage threshold is set with `[usage] unused_days` in `drskill.toml` (default 90 days) and can be overridden per run with `--unused-days`.

Audit only reads trace files. It writes nothing to the ledger, creates no findings, and has no effect on `--ci`.

Parsing every trace on every run would be slow, so audit caches what it extracts from each trace file at `~/.drskill/cache/audit/`. This cache is machine state and is never committed, because it holds the full text of the user messages that preceded each invocation, plus 200-character reasoning excerpts. The same text already exists in the agent trace files it was read from. `drskill cache prune` clears entries for trace files that no longer exist.

## Explain routing

`drskill explain "<query>"` shows where a request would route across your harnesses. Pass the query as a string:

```
drskill explain "summarize this pdf document"
```

The output shows every harness, scores every effective skill against the query using drskill's own similarity model, and renders a verdict. The verdict is one of three:

- "routes to <name>": The top skill scored clearly above the rest. Your agent should reach for it.
- "contested": The top two skills scored too close together. The agent cannot tell them apart, so which one it picks is unpredictable.
- "no skill matches": Nothing scored above the floor, so the agent has no routable skill for this query.

This simulation uses text similarity, not the model that runs your agent. It catches cases where a router could not disambiguate, even if a human or a language model would know the right choice. The output says so.

Add `--deep` to ask the configured model to judge the routing instead:

```
drskill explain "summarize this pdf document" --deep
```

The model reads the query and the top candidates, and returns a verdict. The model verdict prints above drskill's own similarity verdict; both stay visible. This makes one API call per distinct ranking group — harnesses that share an identical ranking share one call. Unlike `scan --deep`, `explain --deep` has no `--max-calls` budget: it always judges every distinct group. The output notes which is which: "drskill's own similarity model" versus "model's judgment."

You can define routing expectations in `drskill.toml` under `[[queries]]`. Each entry holds a query and an optional skill name it should route to. Every `drskill scan` checks every query against every harness, using the same ranking logic as `explain`, and warns if a query routes to the wrong skill or is contested:

```toml
[[queries]]
query = "summarize a pdf"
expect = "pdf-summary"

[[queries]]
query = "list s3 buckets"
```

The first query expects to route to `pdf-summary`; the second just checks that it routes cleanly to something. Any mismatch is a `query-routing` warning, which fails `--ci` unless acknowledged.

Scope the ranking to one harness with `--harness`, or print JSON instead of text with `--json`:

```
drskill explain "query" --harness claude-code --json
```

## Exit codes

`drskill scan`:

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | clean, or every finding is acknowledged |
| 1 | at least one error-level finding is active |
| 2 | only warnings are active, but `--ci` was passed |

Without `--ci`, warnings alone exit 0. This lets you run `drskill scan` locally without it failing your shell, while still failing CI on the same warnings.

`drskill lint`:

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | clean, or nothing at or above the failure threshold |
| 1 | at least one finding at or above the threshold: errors by default, warnings too with `--fail-on warn` |
| 2 | usage error, e.g. the path is not a lintable target |

The two commands use exit 2 differently because they answer different questions. `scan --ci` uses it to separate "errors" from "only warnings" in an existing loadout. `lint` reserves it for "you pointed me at the wrong thing," so a build script can tell a failed check from a broken invocation.

## Checks

| check id | severity | fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `name-shadow` | warning | Two skills share a name in one harness's set and one shadows the other. The message names the winner and the rule that picked it. |
| `double-load` | error | One harness loads the same logical skill twice through two directories. |
| `exact-duplicate` | warning | Two contributors have equal normalized content hashes under different names or paths. |
| `near-duplicate` | warning | Jaccard similarity of MinHash signatures over word shingles is at or above the threshold. The default threshold is 0.85 and can be changed in the ledger. |
| `spec-name-mismatch` | error | Frontmatter `name` does not match the folder name. |
| `spec-missing-description` | error | The description is absent or empty. |
| `spec-description-too-long` | error | The description exceeds 1024 characters. |
| `spec-invalid-frontmatter` | error | The frontmatter does not parse as YAML. |
| `frontmatter-angle-brackets` | warning | Frontmatter values contain angle brackets, which the spec flags as an injection vector. |
| `broken-symlink` | error | A symlink in a skill directory points at nothing. |
| `lockfile-drift` | warning | A skill's content hash does not match its `skills-lock.json` entry. The message attributes the likely cause, e.g. a `gh skill update` or a hand edit, and does not call it corruption. |
| `budget-catalog-tokens` | warning | A harness's total catalog tokens exceed `[budget] catalog_tokens_max`. |
| `budget-body-tokens` | warning | A skill's body tokens exceed `[budget] body_tokens_warn`. |
| `description-overlap` | warning | Two or more descriptions are similar enough that a router could confuse them. The finding names the cluster and the trigger phrases they share. Threshold `description_overlap`. |
| `missing-activation` | warning | A description never states when the skill should trigger, e.g. no "when", "trigger", or "if the user" phrasing. |
| `generic-description` | warning | A description has fewer distinctive words than `generic_min_distinct_tokens`, e.g. "Helps with various tasks." |
| `opposing-imperatives` | warning | Two skills give opposite orders about the same action, e.g. "Always use tabs" against "Never use tabs". Deliberately strict matching, so paraphrased conflicts are not caught. |
| `injection-unicode` | error | Skill text or a bundled file contains bidirectional control characters or zero-width characters. These can hide instructions from a human reviewer. |
| `injection-credential-read` | error | A bundled script references credential paths such as `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, or private key files. Reads of `.env` alone downgrade to a warning. |
| `injection-override` | warning | Skill text contains instruction-override phrasing, e.g. "ignore all previous instructions" or "without informing the user". |
| `injection-mandatory-script` | warning | The skill demands that its own bundled script runs as a required first step, e.g. "you must first run scripts/setup.sh". |
| `injection-egress` | warning | A bundled script calls the network, e.g. `curl` or `requests.post`. The finding quotes each call so you can check the destination. |
| `injection-encoded-blob` | warning | Skill text or a bundled file contains a long base64 or hex run that a reviewer cannot read. |
| `injection-remote-fetch` | warning | Skill text tells the agent to fetch remote content and act on it, e.g. `curl` piped to a shell or "download X and follow the instructions". |
| `injection-shell-unreviewed` | note on first sight, warning on change | A skill embeds an invocation-time shell command (`` !`command` `` or a ```` ```! ```` fenced block). On first sight it is a note listing every command, asking you to record an approved baseline. If the command set later changes, it becomes a warning showing what was removed and what was added. |
| `injection-shell-dangerous` | error for credential-store or credential-named environment-variable reads and a curl/wget pipe to a shell, warning otherwise | An invocation-time shell command matches the same dangerous-content lexicons as the other injection checks: a credential path or environment secret, network egress, or a long encoded blob. Credential-named env variables (like `$OPENAI_API_KEY`, `${GITHUB_TOKEN}`) and bare `printenv` are detected by the same heuristic as the MCP poisoning check. Fires on first sight, independent of the approval baseline above. |
| `mcp-config-invalid` | error | An MCP config file exists but does not parse. |
| `mcp-shadowed-server` | warning | One harness configures the same server name in project and user scope with different settings. The message names the winner. |
| `mcp-diverged-server` | warning | The same server name is configured differently across harnesses. The evidence lists the differing fields. |
| `mcp-secret-in-config` | error in project files, warning in user files | An MCP env block holds a credential-shaped literal value. Evidence names the variable, never the value. |
| `mcp-unpinned-server` | warning | A server runs an unpinned package, e.g. `npx -y pkg` or `pkg@latest`. Whatever publishes next runs next. |
| `mcp-insecure-url` | warning | A remote MCP server uses plaintext `http://`. Localhost is excluded. |
| `mcp-dead-server` | error | A stdio server's command is not on PATH or its absolute path does not exist. |
| `mcp-connect-failed` | warning | A `--mcp-connect` handshake to a server did not connect, timed out, or errored. |
| `mcp-tool-collision` | warning | Two servers expose the same tool name into one harness's set. Which one the agent gets is client dependent. |
| `mcp-tools-unreviewed` | note on first sight, warning on change | A server's enumerated tool set. On first sight it is a note asking you to record an approved baseline. If the server later changes a tool's description, it becomes a warning. |
| `mcp-tool-poisoning` | error for hidden-Unicode and credential-path hits, warning otherwise | Scans tool names, descriptions, and schema doc strings for injection surfaces: hidden instructions, credential paths, invisible Unicode, encoded blobs, remote-fetch directives, and text that steers the agent toward or away from other tools. Runs from committed snapshots, so the whole team gets findings after one person runs `--mcp-connect`. |
| `query-routing` | warning | A query configured in `[[queries]]` is contested between two skills or routes to the wrong skill, or matches nothing when it should match something. The finding names the unexpected routing and what was expected. |

These checks run only under `drskill lint`, against a plugin's manifest and layout. The error findings are the violations the Agent Plugins spec calls fatal, meaning a client rejects the whole plugin; the warnings are the ones a client tolerates or ignores.

| check id | severity | fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin-manifest-invalid` | error | `plugin.json` does not parse, misses a required field (`$schema`, `name`), or gives a field the wrong type. |
| `plugin-name-invalid` | error | The plugin name breaks the spec's rules: 1 to 64 lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, or periods, starting and ending alphanumeric, with no doubled separators. |
| `plugin-manifest-unknown-field` | warning | `plugin.json` carries an unknown top-level field, or `extensions` is not an object. Clients ignore both. |
| `plugin-schema-unknown` | warning | The declared `$schema` is not the 1.0.0 schema. drskill validates against 1.0.0 and says so. |
| `plugin-skill-undiscoverable` | warning | A `skills/` entry no client will load: a child folder without a `SKILL.md`, or a `SKILL.md` nested too deep. |
| `plugin-path-escape` | error | A symlink resolves outside the plugin root. The spec requires clients to reject these paths. |
| `plugin-extension-hygiene` | warning | An extension directory problem: a name that is not a valid reverse-domain namespace, a credential-shaped value in an extension file, or portable components tucked inside a namespace directory where no client loads them. |
| `mcp-spec-invalid` | error | A plugin's `mcp.json` breaks the spec: a missing `$schema`, an unknown transport, a bad command or URL, or `args`, `env`, or `headers` with the wrong types. |
| `mcp-spec-placeholder` | error, warning for headers | `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` or `${PLUGIN_DATA}` somewhere it never expands (the command, an env key), an env entry using a reserved name, or a `cwd` outside the allowed forms. A placeholder in a header value is a warning, because it is sent literally. |

These checks run under `drskill lint` against a Claude Code plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and layout.

| check id | severity | fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `cc-manifest-invalid` | error | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` does not parse, misses the required `name`, the name is not kebab-case, or a component pointer field (`commands`, `agents`, `skills`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`) has the wrong type. |
| `cc-manifest-unknown-field` | warning | The manifest carries a top-level field Claude Code does not document. |
| `cc-component-missing` | error | A component field (e.g. `skills`, `commands`) names a path that does not exist under the plugin root. |
| `cc-manifest-mismatch` | warning | A plugin ships both manifests and they disagree on `name` or `version`. |

These checks run under `drskill lint` against a marketplace: a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, or its listing plugins' supply chain.

| check id | severity | fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `marketplace-invalid` | error, warning for an unrecognized source type | The marketplace descriptor breaks the format: missing `name`, `owner.name`, or `plugins`, a name that is not kebab-case, or a plugin entry missing its required source fields. |
| `marketplace-unpinned-source` | warning, note for a ref-only git pin | A listed plugin's source floats: no `sha` pinning a git source (a `ref` alone downgrades to a note), no npm `version`, no archive `sha256`, or an insecure `http://` URL. |
| `marketplace-command-source` | warning | A plugin installs by running an arbitrary shell command (`source: command`). Review the command before trusting the marketplace. |
| `marketplace-entry-missing` | error | A relative-path plugin entry points at a directory that does not exist. |

## Deep checks

The description-overlap check compares text, so some of its warnings are false alarms. `drskill scan --deep` sends each flagged pair of skills to a language model, which judges whether the two skills are distinct, whether their descriptions collide, or whether their scopes genuinely overlap. Deep mode is included in the standard install; only the minimal `drskill-core` install leaves it out. The only other requirement is a provider API key, e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. drskill sends only skill names and descriptions to the model, and it sends nothing at all unless you pass `--deep`.

The key comes from your environment. To set it once per machine, put it in `~/.drskill/env`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

`drskill` reads this file before a deep run and loads any variable your shell has not already set. The shell always wins. `drskill` never writes a key, and it never reads an env file from inside a project, because a scanned repo is untrusted content.

The judge model is set in the ledger and defaults to a current Anthropic model:

```toml
[deep]
model = "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
```

The model is a LiteLLM model id, so any provider LiteLLM supports works. To use an OpenAI model, set the id and put `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment:

```toml
[deep]
model = "openai/gpt-5.6-luna"
```

The provider is read from the id, so the only change is the model line and the matching key. Everything else, the cache, the budget, and the checks, is the same.

Verdicts are stored in `.drskill/cache/`, one small JSON file per judged pair. Commit this directory. Every scan reads it, with or without `--deep`, so one person runs the judgments and every teammate and CI run gets the verdicts for free. A verdict lasts until either description changes, and then the pair is judged again.

The cache carries the same trust as the ack ledger. Neither file is signed, so anyone who can commit to the repo can silence a warning through either one. Review a change to `.drskill/cache/` the way you review a change to `drskill.toml`.

Each `--deep` run makes at most 25 model calls. Raise or lower the budget with `--max-calls`, or pass `--max-calls all` to judge every flagged pair in one run. When a budget runs out, the report says how many pairs are still unjudged.

When every pair in an overlap cluster is judged distinct, the warning becomes a note. The note still prints, so the model's decision stays on the record, but it does not fail `--ci` and needs no ack. A skill with an unacknowledged injection finding never earns this downgrade. Its pairs are still judged and the verdicts print as evidence, but the warning stays a warning, because a skill suspected of prompt injection does not get to talk its way out of an overlap warning.

When the judge classes a pair as a description collision, the same run also proposes a fix. A second model call rewrites one of the two descriptions, and the finding shows the proposal as a diff: the current description on a minus line, the proposed one on a plus line, with the model's reason for picking that skill. The proposal is model text headed for your skill file, so read it before pasting. drskill never edits the file itself. A rewrite costs one extra call from the same `--max-calls` budget, and a proposal that failed to generate is retried at the start of the next `--deep` run. Once you apply a rewrite, the description has changed, so the next `--deep` run judges the pair fresh, and a good rewrite comes back distinct.

Two commands manage the cache. `drskill cache stats` prints entry counts by verdict, by model, and the age range. `drskill cache prune` deletes verdict entries and tool snapshots that no longer match any configured skill pair or server.

## Shell commands in skills

A skill file is usually just text the agent reads. Claude Code lets it be more than that: [a skill can carry shell commands that Claude Code runs the moment the skill is invoked](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#inject-dynamic-context), _before_ the model sees the file, then splices the output into the prompt. This is a documented feature, [dynamic context injection](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#inject-dynamic-context), and it's useful: a skill can pull in a live `git diff` or the current pull request so the agent reasons about real state instead of guessing.

However, the pattern here can be exploited. A Skill could be updated, either by a Git `pull` or a Skill management tool, and swap in malicious commands that either run bad things on your system or populate the context with exploitative instructions. My own experimentation has found Claude Code has a preprocessor that runs some checks (it won't run commands that have multiple instructions, for example), but commands that _do_ run do so _without requiring user permission_. 

Annoying, my attempts to discover the limits of this behavior tripped Fable's guardrails several times. This behavior isn't well documented, we don't know what the preprocessor checks for, and these commands are allowed by defaults and run _silently_. Whether you add `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or not. Thankfully, [you can globally opt out by setting a flag in settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#:~:text=disableSkillShellExecution).

The potential for rug-pulls here, swapping in malicious commands, is the same pattern we check for with MCP tool updates. `drskill` implements a similar approach: it makes every command in a skill visible to you and asks you to approve a specific _set_ of commands. If this set changes, after your approval, you will be warned.

Commands that look suspicious will be flagged immediately.

Command files under `.claude/commands` (project) and `~/.claude/commands` (personal) use the same shell syntax. They go through the full markdown-side injection scan (unicode, encoded blobs, instruction overrides, remote fetches) plus the two shell-command checks above. When `disableSkillShellExecution` is set in Claude Code settings, findings indicate the commands do not run on this machine.

## MCP servers

Skills are half of an agent's loadout. MCP servers are the other half, and each harness configures them in its own file: `.mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json` for Claude Code, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor, `.vscode/mcp.json` for VS Code, `~/.codex/config.toml` for Codex, `.gemini/settings.json` for Gemini CLI, and `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop. drskill reads all of them on every scan. It only reads. Nothing is launched, and no server is connected to.

The `mcp-` checks in the table above cover what the config files alone can show: the same server configured twice with drifted settings, credential-shaped values sitting in a committable file, unpinned `npx` packages, plaintext remote URLs, and commands that no longer exist. A `?` after a harness name on an mcp finding means drskill has not verified that harness's config format against its docs.

See every configured server in one table:

```
drskill list --mcp
```

### Connecting to servers

The checks above read config files. To see what tools a server actually exposes, drskill has to ask the server:

```
drskill scan --mcp-connect
```

This connects to every configured server, runs the MCP handshake, and reads its tool list. drskill only enumerates. It never calls a tool, and it never reads a server's resources or prompts. Each server gets 15 seconds, and one that hangs is killed. A server that fails to connect becomes an `mcp-connect-failed` warning, and the scan moves on. Connecting needs the full install, since it uses the MCP SDK; a minimal `drskill-core` install leaves it out.

Each successful handshake writes a snapshot of the server's tools into `.drskill/cache/mcp-tools/`. The snapshot holds tool names, descriptions, and token counts. It holds no secret. Commit this directory. Every later scan reads the snapshots, so tool findings, the token bill, and the conflict checks work for the whole team without anyone connecting again, labeled "as of" the snapshot date.

Once tools are known, three things happen. Their descriptions flow through the same `description-overlap` and deep checks as skills, so a tool that collides with another tool or with a skill is flagged. The scan header gains the context bill: the size of the largest harness's starting context, split between its skill catalog and its MCP tool definitions.

And `mcp-tools-unreviewed` handles the tool descriptions themselves. A tool description is text the server writes, not you, and the agent loads it as instructions, so a server you trust can quietly rewrite it later. The first time drskill sees a server's tools it prints a note asking you to record them as an approved baseline. Acking saves that exact set. If the server later changes a tool's description or schema, the note becomes a warning that fails `--ci`, and the warning names each changed tool and shows its old text next to its new text, so you find out that a server changed what it tells your agent after you trusted it.

Snapshots fingerprint schema text as well as descriptions, and that coverage has grown over time. If you upgrade drskill and it now fingerprints more of a server's text than it did when you approved it, an unchanged server does not come back as a rug-pull warning. You get a one-time note instead, asking you to re-ack once to extend your approved baseline to the new fingerprint.

`mcp-tool-poisoning` reads the same committed snapshots and scans tool names, descriptions, and schema doc strings for injection surfaces: hidden instructions, credential paths, invisible Unicode, encoded blobs, remote-fetch directives, and text that steers the agent toward or away from other tools. Like the other MCP checks it is static and reads only what was captured at connect time, so the whole team gets findings the moment one person runs `--mcp-connect`, with no reconnect required. A server that legitimately manages credentials, e.g. an AWS or Kubernetes tool whose parameter docs name `~/.aws/credentials`, will trip the credential-path error on first connect. That is the check working as designed: read the quoted text, and if the mention is expected, `drskill ack mcp-tool-poisoning <server>` records your decision and the error stays silent until that tool's text changes.

### MCP servers in loadouts

`drskill loadout create` lists the MCP tools it finds next to your skills.
Selecting a tool adds its whole server to the loadout as one entry. The
entry records the server's transport, command, arguments, url, and the
names of its env variables. Env values never leave your machine.

`drskill loadout install` writes each MCP entry into the target MCP
config. In a project it writes `.mcp.json`. Pass `--harness` to target a
harness that reads a different file. A server that is already configured
with the same settings is reported as already installed. A server with
the same name but different settings is held unless you pass `--force`.
Configs that drskill cannot write, such as Codex's `config.toml`, get a
printed block you can paste in yourself.

After installing a server, fill in its env values and run
`drskill scan --mcp-connect` to review the tools it exposes.

`drskill loadout status` compares each MCP entry against your configured
servers and reports matches, changed, or missing.

`drskill loadout update` republishes a loadout's entries from their local
copies, refreshing changed content. A skill or server present in the loadout
but missing or unreadable locally stays published as before.

A skill install also records a pin: `.drskill/pins.json` for a project
install, `~/.drskill/pins.json` for a user-scope one, binding the directory
drskill wrote to the loadout, revision, and content hash it came from.
`drskill loadout status` and `drskill loadout update` read these pins to
match each entry to the exact installed copy instead of guessing by name, so
two skills that happen to share a name don't get confused. The project file
is meant to be committed, like the caches. Pins are trusted local data too.
Status and update follow them, so review pin edits like code.

`drskill loadout edit owner/slug [--harness id]` edits a loadout's membership
interactively in a terminal. Published entries with no local counterpart appear
pre-checked as "(published; not on this machine)". MCP entries with no locally
configured server show as phantoms too and can be kept or removed like any
entry. Kept entries republish exactly as fetched. New entries are added to
the membership. Use `loadout update` to refresh changed content instead.

## The ledger

`drskill.toml` sits at the root of your repo and should be committed. It holds your budgets, your thresholds, and your decisions. When you run `drskill ack`, it appends an entry to the end of the file and touches nothing else, so your comments and formatting are preserved. An entry looks like this:

```toml
[[ack]]
check = "near-duplicate"
skills = ["docx-report", "documentation-writer"]
fingerprint = "sha256:..."
note = "docx is output format specific; keeping both"
date = 2026-07-19
```

A finding's fingerprint is a hash of the check id plus the content of every skill involved. An ack silences a finding only while that fingerprint still matches. If you edit one of the skills named in the ack, its content hash changes, the fingerprint no longer matches, and the finding comes back on the next scan. This is deliberate. An ack means "this exact situation is fine," not "never check this pair again."

In global mode (`--global`), the ledger lives at `~/.drskill.toml` instead.

Acks are scope aware. When a finding involves only machine-level skills, e.g. a vendored skill under your home directory that has nothing to do with the current repo, `drskill ack` writes the ack to `~/.drskill.toml` and says so. Every project scan honors acks from both ledgers, so you decide once per machine instead of once per repo. When any project skill is involved, the ack goes to the project's committed `drskill.toml` as before. Two flags override the routing: `--local` forces the project ledger, and `--global-ack` forces the machine ledger.

## Reading the report

Findings print errors first, then warnings. Inside each section the order is: findings you have not seen before, then findings on skills you installed, then findings on harness-vendored skills, which carry a `[system skill]` label. A finding you have not seen carries a `new` tag, and the summary line counts them. The memory behind the `new` tag lives in `~/.drskill/state/`, one small file per project. It only records what the report has shown you; it is not the ledger, and `--json` runs never touch it, so an agent polling `drskill` does not clear your markers. When a finding affects every detected harness, the harness line collapses to a count, e.g. "all 7 harnesses". Checks that flag description quality report one finding listing every offending skill, so three skills with the same problem are one entry and one ack.

The `source` column in `list` shows where a skill came from: `skills-lock` for skills named in a project's `skills-lock.json`, `gh-skill` for skills with `gh skill` provenance in their frontmatter, and `linked` for skills that live in or link into a `.agents/skills` store. The `linked` label means an installer arranged the layout; `drskill` does not guess which one. `unmanaged` means a plain directory with no known manager.

`list` shows a harness's whole loadout in one table: its skills and its MCP servers. Each row has a `kind` (`skill`, `mcp server`, or `mcp tool`) and a `suite`. A configured server shows as one `mcp server` row until you run `--mcp-connect`; after that it expands into one `mcp tool` row per tool the server exposes. The rows are sorted by suite, so a suite reads as a block: all your superpowers skills together, then the rest, then each server and its tools together.

The `suite` column names where a row came from. For a skill it is the plugin or repo. `drskill` recovers a plugin suite by matching the skill's content against the plugin caches on disk, so a plugin skill copied into a shared store is still recognized. For a skill that a lockfile tracks, the suite is the lockfile source, the same origin the `source` column records. For an MCP tool the suite is the server that exposes it. A skill with neither a plugin match nor a lockfile source shows a blank suite, because `drskill` does not guess a suite from a path or a bare name.

## Known limitations

`skills-lock.json` hash verification is self-calibrating. Upstream `npx skills` computes its own content hashes, and `drskill` cannot always reproduce them exactly. If none of the hashes in a lockfile match what `drskill` computes, it will not accuse every skill of drift; instead it prints one warning saying the hashes could not be verified against that lockfile. Per-skill drift warnings only appear once `drskill` has confirmed, by matching at least one hash, that its hashing algorithm agrees with that lockfile's producer.

Harness rules are verified in two parts, because they have two different jobs. Paths verification covers which directories a harness reads and whether it searches them recursively. Precedence verification covers which copy wins when two skills share a name. Claude Code, Pi, Gemini CLI, Codex, Cline, and Copilot are verified on both — Copilot empirically, by probing its CLI with fixture skills, since its docs are silent and the code is closed. Cursor is verified on paths only, since its docs do not say which copy wins a collision. OpenCode is verified on paths, but its precedence is deliberately left unverified: probing showed its collision winner flips between runs, so a same-name collision there is effectively a coin flip. About 65 further harnesses are vendored from the `vercel-labs/skills` project and are unverified on both.

A finding only inherits the uncertainty it actually depends on. Shadowing and double-load findings depend on precedence; every other finding depends only on paths. When a harness in a finding's list is unverified for the part that finding depends on, its name carries a `?` suffix, and the report ends with one legend line explaining it. A finding with no `?` rests entirely on verified rules.

Token counts are approximate. `drskill` counts tokens with `tiktoken`'s `o200k_base` encoding, which is a reasonable estimate but will not match every harness's actual tokenizer or catalog rendering exactly.

The seven injection checks flag surfaces; they do not verify intent. Static analysis cannot prove a skill benign or hostile, so every injection finding quotes the exact lines it judged and leaves the verdict to you. A clean scan is not a security guarantee, and a finding is not an accusation. Bundled files that are binary or larger than 1 MiB are recorded but not content scanned, and the report says so when that happens. A bundled file counts as a script when it has a script extension or a shebang line; everything else is scanned as prose, so the script-only checks (egress, credential reads) do not look inside files disguised as plain text.

The four description and instruction checks are heuristics. Their thresholds are tuned against real public skill sets to stay quiet on well-written skills, and every finding can be acknowledged, but they will miss paraphrased conflicts and will flag some judgment calls. The thresholds live in `drskill.toml`:

```toml
[thresholds]
near_duplicate = 0.85
description_overlap = 0.6
generic_min_distinct_tokens = 2
```
